# Final Year Project

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.

This is the repository for my final year project to access the code visit src code. Here you can run the visualisation and the genetic algorithm.

# Explanation of the programs:

To run the program open and run gaprogram, this contains the GUI and the visualisation for the TSP problem.

The TSPGA part of the project consists of four main files: TSPGA_application, test_TSPGA, TSPGA, and gaprogram. 
TSPGA_application is the main program that contains both the GUI and the visual representation of the TSP problem. test_TSPGA is a program that holds the test cases for TSPGA. TSPGA is the first TSP program developed with a genetic algorithm implementation. Finally, a folder PracticeCode has all the GA's coded for practice and understanding an example is simplega is a simple genetic algorithm that aims to satisfy the expression in the foo function.
