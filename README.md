# Final Year Project

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.

This is the repository for my final year project to access the code visit src code. Here you can run the visualisation and the genetic algorithm.
