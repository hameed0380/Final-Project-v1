# Final Year Project

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.

This is the repository for my final year project to access the code visit src code. Here you can run the visualisation and the genetic algorithm.

# Explanation of the programs:

To run the program open and run TSPGA_application, this contains the GUI and the visualisation for the TSP problem.

The test_TSPGA program contains test cases for the TSPGA program. The TSPGA program is the first TSP program I worked on with an implementation of a genetic algorithm. 

The simplega is the first genetic algorithm I worked on, a simple genetic algorithm to satisfy the expression below in th function foo. Whilst gui shows the an implementation of the GUI.
