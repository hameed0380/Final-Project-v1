# Final Year Project

Genetic Algorithm Project

Implement a GA and apply it to various optimisation problems such as constraint satisfaction.
This is the repository for my final year project to access the code visit src code. Here you can run the visualisation and the genetic algorithm.

# Explanation of the programs:

To run the program open and run prototype1, this contains the GUI and the visualisation for the TSP problem. Watch the demonstration video.

The TSPGA part of the project consists of four main files: TSPGA_application, test_TSPGA, TSPGA, and prototype1. 
TSPGA_application is the main program that contains both the GUI and the visual representation of the TSP problem. test_TSPGA is a program that holds the test cases for TSPGA. TSPGA is the first TSP program developed with a genetic algorithm implementation. Finally, a folder PracticeCode has all the GA's coded for practice and understanding an example is simplega is a simple genetic algorithm that aims to satisfy the expression in the foo function.
