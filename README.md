# Final Year Project

Genetic Algorithm Project
CS4822 - Real-World Problem-Solving with Genetic Algorithms: A Practical Exploration of Metaheuristic Optimisation

Implement a GA and apply it to various optimisation problems such as constraint satisfaction.
This is the repository for my final year project to access the code visit src. Here you can run the visualisation and the genetic algorithm.

# Explanation of other programs:
The TSPGA part of the project consists of two files: test_TSPGA, TSPGA 
test_TSPGA is a program that holds the test cases for TSPGA. 
TSPGA is the first TSP program developed with a genetic algorithm implementation. 
Finally, a folder Experimentation has all the GA's coded for practice and understanding an example is simplega is a simple genetic algorithm that aims to satisfy the expression in the foo function.

# Running The Project
To install the dependencies from this file, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file with their specified versions.

Then navigate to the directory containing the GenAlgoLab.py file, you can now run the project using the following command:

    python GenAlgoLab.py


# GenAlgoLab Instruction Manual

This instruction manual will guide you through the steps to run and use the GenAlgoLab, a genetic algorithm project that demonstrates solutions to various constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Knapsack, and N-Queens.

Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. The following Python libraries installed:
    tkinter
    ttkthemes
3. The source code files for the project:
    GenAlgoLab.py (the main GUI file)
    TSPGA_application.py (TSP Genetic Algorithm application)
    knap.py (Knapsack application)
    qN.py (N-Queens application)
    GUI.py (Interactive Genetic Algorithm application)
4. An image file named "noun-genetic-algorithm(CCBY3.0).png" in the same directory as the GenAlgoLab.py file.

Using the Program
1. In the main window, click on the "CSP" menu item in the menu bar.
2. A dropdown menu will appear with the following options: TSP, Knapsack, and Nqueen. Click on the desired option to run the corresponding genetic algorithm application.
    TSP: Traveling Salesman Problem
    Knapsack: Knapsack Problem
    Nqueen: N-Queens Problem
3. Each option will open a separate window running the selected genetic algorithm application.
4. To run the Interactive Genetic Algorithm application, click on the "Interactive GA" menu item in the menu bar. A separate window will open running the interactive genetic algorithm application.
5. For more information about the GenAlgoLab project and the Traveling Salesman Problem Genetic Algorithm, click on the "Info" menu item in the menu bar. A help window will open displaying information about the project.
6. To close the main window and all open application windows, click on the "Force Quit" button in the main window.
