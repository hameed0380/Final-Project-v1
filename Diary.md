This is the first test of my diary. ~02/10/2022

# Week 26-2 Oct
This week I reviewed ideas for my project plan and added a section on risks and mitigations. I realised that creating proof of concepts and simple programs can help identify other risks and mitigations. 

After talking in more depth and asking questions to my supervisor I rationalised that starting with simple constraints e.g. integers rather than real numbers or even possibly boolean would be a good start and/or first target. I have also decided that rather than starting on the gui, since this project mostly looks at the genetic algotrithm rather than physical attributes it would be best to start with a simple gui and focus much more on understanding and creating the genetic algorithms.

# Week 3-9 Oct
This week I have created some sketches for a simple temporary gui which will be done in tkinter and  javascript at some point of the week to help me identify which would be more suitable to program in.

After doing some research, I decided that installing sublime text to use as an IDE to construct the graphical interface would be the best option. 

After some experimentation I have found that doing the project in python would be the best idea particularly for producing visual genetic algorithms.

# Week 10-16
This week I have created a simple GUI in tkiniter for the project, I have done some experimentation with the features and widgets available and have an idea of how I want the GUI to look like. I have also started creating simple Genetic algorithms and am looking particularly at the TSP.

# Week 17-23
During this week I created a simple genetic algorithm to understand how they work and how it can be applied to the project. I also did some research and a write up on genetic algorithms to form the basis of my report.

# Week 24-30
For this week I have started creating the TSP genetic algorithm. From creating a simple GA from before I now have a good understanding of how genetic algorithms work and it has helped me to do this. In addition, adding a small section of encoding various problems with GA's which I will expand upon.


# Week 31-6
So far this week I have worked on the TSP genetic algorithm and am close to finishing it up. I have found that it is much better to use a class for this program rather then a series of methods. I have also updated the style and the layout of the report. Overall, I have made quite some progress this week, but I have to admit that more can be done, this was in large part due to multiple submittions and deadlines for my dat analysis module which has been quite tricky. Going forward I intend to work even more on the project. I have also now included the project plan making it easier to access and work of on.


# Week 7-13
This week I worked more on thhe report adding sections to do with genetic algorithms such as the introduction and other apects nasmely being theory of coalescence, genetic drift and encoding. Also added a little bit of code.


# Week 14-20
This week I was slightly confused with the remaining part of the genetic algorithm so I decided to take a step back and do more research. Moving on from this I also worked on the report adding to the technical section as well as genetic drift and design pattterns. Upon further research I have now concluded that doing the majority of the project in tkinter is not viable and requires more time then provided. So I decided I will be doing the visualisation portion of the project in pygame for now.


# Week 21-27
This week I have worked towarsd getting a basic TSP genetic algorithm completed, this will further reinforce my knowledge and help me with the processes that take place in evolutionary algorithms. I feel ill with covid so for some days I was not able to complete work as best as I feel I could but I am on track now. This week I have now uploaded the full TSP GA I have been working on with full comments. In the coming week I will include the visualisation for this however due to time constraints I will prorblem have to use a set of constant numbers.


# Week 28-2
This week I worked on the visualisation for my project in pygame and worked more on the Gui in tkinter. I also worked on the report detailing my proof of concepts and going into more detail about the encoding of my project. The test case for the TSP GA was also uploaded.
