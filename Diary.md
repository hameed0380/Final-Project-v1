This is the first test of my diary. ~02/10/2022

# Week 26-2 Oct
This week I reviewed ideas for my project plan and added a section on risks and mitigations. I realised that creating proof of concepts and simple programs can help identify other risks and mitigations. 

After talking in more depth and asking questions to my supervisor I rationalised that starting with simple constraints e.g. integers rather than real numbers or even possibly boolean would be a good start and/or first target. I have also decided that rather than starting on the gui, since this project mostly looks at the genetic algotrithm rather than physical attributes it would be best to start with a simple gui and focus much more on understanding and creating the genetic algorithms.

# Week 3-9 Oct
This week I have created some sketches for a simple temporary gui which will be done in tkinter and  javascript at some point of the week to help me identify which would be more suitable to program in.

After doing some research, I decided that installing sublime text to use as an IDE to construct the graphical interface would be the best option. 

After some experimentation I have found that doing the project in python would be the best idea particularly for producing visual genetic algorithms.

# Week 10-16
This week I have created a simple GUI in tkiniter for the project, I have done some experimentation with the features and widgets available and have an idea of how I want the GUI to look like. I have also started creating simple Genetic algorithms and am looking particularly at the TSP.

# Week 17-23
During this week I created a simple genetic algorithm to understand how they work and how it can be applied to the project. I also did some research and a write up on genetic algorithms to form the basis of my report.

# Week 24-30
