# Week 26-2 Oct
This week I reviewed ideas for my project plan and added a section on risks and mitigations. I realised that creating proof of concepts and simple programs can help identify other risks and mitigations. 

After talking in more depth and asking questions to my supervisor I rationalised that starting with simple constraints e.g. integers rather than real numbers or even possibly boolean would be a good start and/or first target. I have also decided that rather than starting on the gui, since this project mostly looks at the genetic algotrithm rather than physical attributes it would be best to start with a simple gui and focus much more on understanding and creating the genetic algorithms.
